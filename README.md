## Features: -
- Upload Dataset: Users can upload a CSV file containing their dataset.
- Data Preprocessing: Missing values are handled using SimpleImputer, and categorical variables are encoded using OneHotEncoder.
- Model Selection/Specification: Users can select the target variable and choose between classification or regression tasks.
- Visualization of Models: Model comparison metrics are displayed to help users make informed decisions.
- Download Model: Functionality to download trained models for later use.


## Dependencies: -
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- PyCaret
